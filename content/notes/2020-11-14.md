With COVID and being quarantined, I think it's easy to feel like my world is really small -- like it's just the confines of my room and my laptop and what I do at work. A few weeks ago, I happened across an email for a virtual talk hosted by [Jacobs](https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/design-conversations/). I'd forgotten I was even on the mailing list. It sounded interesting and was public so I decided to check it out. The talk turned out *awesome* (so much so I wrote about in my most recent blog). I was impressed with how smoothly it was facilitated despite it being virtual....There's probably a bunch of talks that are more accessible now in a virtual world! I need to keep my eyes out for more virtual events like this, and take them as opportunities to expand my world in these COVID times.

Also, most meetups around the world hosting virtual events are probably game?!
