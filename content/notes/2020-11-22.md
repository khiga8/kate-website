Some Rails-y things I've learned recently.

- **Rails routes are VERY customizable.**
  If you need your route to look a certain way, you can probably make it happen.
  Rails has SO MANY different customizations available. The answer is [in the guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) somewhere.

- **Rails has a bunch of form helper methods available that eliminate the need for
  manual name assignments.** Recently I learned about [fields_for](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/fields_for).
  I also learned that with [form_with](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/form_with), you can set a
  scope that lets you prefix the name with the set scope.
