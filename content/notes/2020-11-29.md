Today, I stopped by Green Apple Bookstore. I picked up a book called, "Wasting Time
on the Internet" by Kenneth Goldsmith.

In the book, Goldsmith argues that the internet is actually making us smarter, more
creative, and more productive. He talks about how we're reading more than ever. He
calls Facebook the greatest collective autobiography, which I can't argue with.

A very interesting perspective.
