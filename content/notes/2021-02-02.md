[Ruby for Good] is awesome and I highly recommend
for anyone looking to get involved in open source projects!
Here's a [list] of their volunteer-driven projects!

Reflecting on my experience in the past few months:

Things I appreciate:
* Friendly slack community of Rubyists
* Beginner friendly labels on project issues
* Well-documented README to allow anyone to contribute
* Weekly office hours for questions! (might depend on the project).
