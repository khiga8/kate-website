# Kate Higa

I am a software engineer who enjoys working at the intersection of people and technology. I currently work at GitHub as part of the Accessibility team.

I mostly grew up in the Bay Area, spent some time in Japan, and am now based in Brooklyn. When I'm away from my computer, I enjoy visiting bakeries in the area, crocheting, and unwinding with my dog, Tag√©.
