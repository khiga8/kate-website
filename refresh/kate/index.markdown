# Kate Higa

I am a software engineer who enjoys working at the intersection of people and technology. I currently work at GitHub as part of the Accessibility team.

I have a background in Cognitive Science and am fascinated by the human mind. I am a Japanese American fluent in English and Japanese. On the weekends, I love visiting bakeries in the area, baking, and unwinding with my dog, Tag√©.

I like to write casually mostly as a way to reflect and retain my thoughts and learnings.
